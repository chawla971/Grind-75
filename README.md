# Grind 75 â€“ LeetCode Practice Challenge ðŸ§ 

This repository contains my solutions to the **Grind 75** coding interview challenge â€” a curated list of LeetCode problems designed to strengthen data structure and algorithm skills for technical interviews.

Each problem is organized in its own folder with clean, well-documented Python solutions.  
Iâ€™m using this repository to build consistency, improve problem-solving speed, and deepen my understanding of core topics like arrays, hash maps, strings, linked lists, dynamic programming, and graph traversal.
